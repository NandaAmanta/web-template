# web-template
This is my personal project (just for fun) and it is a web template builder. So how it works? first the web template builder will show you some kind of templates like navbar templates, banner templates, footer tamplates etc. Then you can choose your favorite templates. Finnaly the web template builder will build you a simple starter project (HTML,CSS,JS) and of course with your templates inside..
